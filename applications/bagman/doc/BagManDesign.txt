BagMan
======

A file collection manager.

Use cases
---------

Use case: Cloning a Hard Disk and collecting contextual information.
I wish to clone a hard disk onto the file-system.
I may also wish to add other files to the collection (e.g. email describing the content).
Similarly, in other circumstances, we wish to transfer the content from a HD to 
another store, building and storing a checksum manifest along the way.

Use case: Transferring files into bags held on safe storage locations.
I have a set of files on a disk.
I wish to transfer them to a network drive, using a bag format at the destination.

Interface
---------
The term 'Collection' is used to describe any set of files, from a simple folder 
to a BagIt bag. The interface should present some simple preservation actions 
that can be applied to Collections. Under the hood, the same 'action' 
might map to one of a number of different operations, depending on the Collection Type.
