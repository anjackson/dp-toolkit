Digital Preservation Tool Integration
=====================================

This is an experiment in using izpack to registry a simple shell extension for bootstrapping the initiation of DP workflows in a manner that is more closely integrated with the Windows platform.

It kinda works, but there the shell extension only shows up when you right-click the desktop background, not in the general filer windows. I think I'll need an actuall shell extension to do this right, which means a .Net starter.
