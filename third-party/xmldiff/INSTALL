Thank you for downloading the XMLDiff tool.


System Requirements
-------------------

The prerequisites for running XMLDiff version 1.0 are:-

- You have the Java 2 Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your 
  machine (preferably the J2SE v1.4.2 JRE  - which is distributed
  under the terms of the BSD License and can be downloaded from 
  http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html).

- You have dom4j installed on your machine (dom4j v1.4 has been distributed 
  with this XMLDiff release).

- You have xercesImpl.jar and xml-apis.jar from the Xerces-J distribution
  installed on your machine (these jar files, as distributed with dom4j v1.4,
  have been distributed with this XMLDiff release)


Building XMLDiff from source
----------------------------

If you wish to build XMLDiff from the xmldiff source, please refer to the
instructions provided in BUILD.


Running XMLDiff
---------------

Before you can use the XMLDiff tool, you must first modify the bash
wrapper script ('xmldiff') to reference the distributed libraries
and Java libraries on your machine. This can be done as follows:-

The bash wrapper script currently looks like:
 
 #!/bin/bash

 JAVA_HOME="/usr/java/j2sdk1.4.2_03/jre"
 DOM4J_HOME="./dom4j-full.jar"
 XERCES_HOME="./xercesImpl.jar"
 XMLAPIS_HOME="./xml-apis.jar"
 XMLDIFF_HOME="./XMLDiff.jar"
 SCHEMA_HOME="./XMLDiff_schema.xsd"

 $JAVA_HOME/bin/java -cp $DOM4J_HOME:$XMLDIFF_HOME:$XERCES_HOME:$XMLAPIS_HOME:$SCHEMA_HOME epcc.xmldiff.Main $1 $2 $3 $4 $5

You should 
1) Edit the 'JAVA_HOME' variable to reference the absolute path to 
   the location where you installed the Java 2 Runtime Environment.
2) Edit the 'DOM4J_HOME', 'XERCES_HOME' and 'XMLAPIS_HOME' variables 
   to reference the absolute paths to the locations where you 
   installed the dom4j-full, xercesImpl and xml-apis jar files 
   respectively (which were distributed with this XMLDiff release).
3) Edit the 'XMLDIFF_HOME' variable to reference the absolute path to
   the location where you installed the XMLDiff jar file distributed
   with this XMLDiff release.
4) Lastly, edit the 'SCHEMA_HOME' variable to reference the absolute 
   path to the location where you installed the XMLDiff_schema.xsd
   file distributed with this XMLDiff release.

You are now ready to run XMLDiff.

You can run XMLDiff either via the bash wrapper script, for example

 xmldiff test/control.xml test/candidate.xml test/metric.xml test/log

 or if you wish to validate a metric document:-
 xmldiff -m test/metric.xml test/log

or from the command line using:

 java -cp dom4j-full.jar:XMLDiff.jar:xercesImpl.jar:xml-apis.jar:XMLDiff_schema.xsd epcc.xmldiff.Main test/control.xml test/candidate.xml test/metric.xml test/log

whereby the java executable must be either set in your path or via the
'JAVA_HOME' environment variable and the location of the dom4j-full, 
XMLDiff, xercesImpl and xml-apis jar files and XMLDiff_schema.xsd file
specified appropriately.
